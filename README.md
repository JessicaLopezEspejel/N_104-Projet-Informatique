# Projet-Informatique: Search engine for Covid-19

###Course: IN104
###ENSTA, Institut Polytechnique Paris

## Context

Over the years, health issues have been studied by 
doctors and researchers. However, due to the pandemic 
situation, thousands of institutions and scientists 
are mobilized to tackle the Coronavirus (Covid-19). 
In consequence, the number of medical articles has 
been increasing exponentially.

With the continuous increase in the  amount of digital 
documents in the web, it is challenging for researchers 
and scientists to find articles related to the domain 
of interest. However, having an adequate tool can save 
time considerably. For instance, a search engine is a 
good choice to find the most related articles to the 
keywords one is searching for. Inspired by
[discovid.ai](https://www.kaggle.com/danielwolffram/discovid-ai-a-search-and-recommendation-engine?select=metadata.csv) 
we propose you to build your own search engine for Covid-19.

## Instructions

The codes presented are not optimized and contain errors. 
Therefore, based on your Python classes you should optimize the code, 
and use classes, objects and instances. In addition, you should 
implement the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, 
inheritance, and polymorphism.


Your code should use PEP 8 as a style guide for Python code.
